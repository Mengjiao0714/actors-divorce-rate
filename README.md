# The divorce rates for the celebrities

Celebrity divorce seems to be in the news every day, whether it’s a real divorce or just a rumored one! Do celebrities really get divorced more often? Or do we just hear about it more because they’re in the limelight?

In this repo, we first extract the top 1000 actors and actresses listed on IMDb (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058011111/?sort=list_order,asc&mode=detail&page=1). Then for each actor or actress, we open his/her biography table on Wikipedia and scrape the basic information such as birth date, occupation, and spouse(s) including spouse name and married/divorced year.

## General divorce rate
The divorce rate for the general popuation in the US depends on if it’s the first, second, or third marriage, according to the following statistics:

First marriage divorce rate = `45% – 50%`;

Second marriage divorce rate = `60% – 67%`;

Third marriage divorce rate = `73% – 74%`.

## Divorce rate for the actors and actresses
Based on the data for 944 actors and actresses we scraped from Wikipedia, the first marraige divorce rate is 54.2%, which is unsurprisingly significant higher than the general rate of 45%-50%. However, the second and the thrid marriage divorce rates of 51.4% and 50%, respectively, both are statistically significant lower than the divorce rates for the general population. What a surprise!
